# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Running with Docker

You can also build and run this project using Docker. The provided Docker setup uses Node.js version 22.13.1 and serves the built static files using the `serve` package.

### Build and Run

To build and start the application using Docker Compose, run:

```
docker compose up --build
```

This will build the Docker image and start the service defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

- The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
- The container exposes port **5173**

### Configuration

- No environment variables are required by default.
- No external dependencies or volumes are needed for this setup.
- The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build for optimized image size and security (non-root user).

> **Note:** If you need to customize environment variables, you can uncomment and use the `env_file` section in `docker-compose.yml`.
